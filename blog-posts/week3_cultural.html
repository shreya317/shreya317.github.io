		<h2>How Do I Think?</h2>
		<h4>By Shreya Patel</h4>
		<h4 class="date">July 3, 2014</h4>
		<p>According to the personal thinking style quiz, my thinking style is Abstract Random. I had no idea what that meant, so I did a little research and this is what I found out. As an abstract random thinker, I organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-orientated environments.</p>
		<p>My mind is always reflecting on my actions, feelings, and ideas. This process brings me to a conclusion that helps in making future decisions, and creating and breaking habits. Relationships are also very important to me, whether they be in personal or professional environments. These people-orientated environments constantly encourage me to be mindful, interactive, and, patient. Although, I think of myself to be free-spirited behavior wise, when it comes to learning I think I thrive in structured environments. I believe this is because, without structure I tend to procrastinate or fall off track.</p>
