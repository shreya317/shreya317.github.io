		<h2>How Do I Think?</h2>
		<h4>By Shreya Patel</h4>
		<h4 class="date">July 3, 2014</h4>
		<p>According to the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html" target="blank">personal thinking style quiz</a>, my thinking style is Abstract Random. I had no idea what that meant, so I did a little research and this is what I found out. As an abstract random thinker, I organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-orientated environments.</p>
		<p>My mind is always reflecting on my actions, feelings, and ideas. This process brings me to a conclusion that helps in making future decisions, and creating and breaking habits. Relationships are also very important to me, whether they be in personal or professional environments. These people-orientated environments constantly encourage me to be mindful, interactive, and, patient. Although, I think of myself to be free-spirited behavior wise, when it comes to learning I think I thrive in structured environments. I believe this is because, without structure I tend to procrastinate or fall off track.</p>
		<p>Since the start of Phase 0, DBC encourages reflecting at end of each challenge. I think it’s a great way to conclude your thoughts about what and how you learned during that challenge. As an abstract random thinker, I’m able to apply myself towards these reflections. This helps me acknowledge what I’m having difficulty with and where I need to improve. </p>
		<p>The DBC culture is all about working with one another, whether it’s via pair programming, discussing on google community, or giving feedback.  It’s a rich people-orientated environment where people thrive off each other.  This kind of environment is great for a thinker like me, I’m able to work with groups of people, learn from others, and give and receive feedback.</p>
		<p>My biggest struggle with Phase 0 is time management. I often am caught up in one or two challenges not realizing I do not have much time for the remaining challenges. To help me with this issue, I made a habit of looking at all the challenges in detail at the beginning of the week.  This helps me to identify which challenges will need more time or practice. I also learned to implement time boxing, which allows me to optimize my learning with reachable goals in a given period of time. Overall, this minimizes being caught up in one specific challenge or part of a challenge for too long. </p>
