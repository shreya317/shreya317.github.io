		<h2>Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>
		<h4>By Shreya Patel</h4>
		<h4 class="date">July 20th, 2014</h4>
		
		<p>After watching Shereef’s Fireside Chat, I feel very motivated to embrace the DBC culture. It seems that DBC has created an environment, where students of all backgrounds can come in and work together towards a common goal. I thought Shereef’s Kitchen vs. Table analogy was a great comparison of how it’s important to grow by getting your hands dirty versus expecting something in return for something.</p>

		<p>I’m nervous and excited to experience the DBC culture. I know DBC will provide the material to learn, but it’s actually up to me to learn, absorb, and utilize it. I believe that at the end of the day you get what you put in. Like Shereef said “..It only works, if everybody walking in through the door says, “This is my program, these are my nine weeks, I’m going to make them amazing, get out of my way!””</p>
		
		<p>DBC here I come!</p>
