			<p>Twitter is one of my top three favorite websites. It’s a social website where you can share and read just about anything by following other users. The neat thing about twitter is that you can hash tag your post (called a tweet) and it connects to all the tweets tagged with that hash. You can see trending hash tags related to news, celebrities, events, etc.  If you like a tweet you can favorite it and you can also share tweets by re-tweeting it. Not only can you share your thoughts, but also you can attach pictures and share articles.</p>
			<p>The most important and easily drawn to part of the website is the center column of the homepage. The center column is the newsfeed where all the tweets of the people you follow are. The newsfeed updates chronologically, with the most current tweet on top.</p>
			<p>The twitter layout is simple, organized, and contemporary. It follows a simple three-column layout on all of its pages. You have the option to customize your background, font colors, and upload a profile picture along with a bit of information about you. Twitter is easy to navigate, as the navigation bar is always located at the top no matter the page of the website you are visiting. You can easily browse through your newsfeed, view other user profiles, and see trending hash tags all from your homepage.</p>
			<p>Overall, twitter is a clever, fun, and a dynamic way of sharing and connecting with people around the world. It’s also very convenient, since you can access it from a computer or data phone. Although, it can be addicting you will always learn something new.</p>
