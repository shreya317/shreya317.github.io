      <h3>A somewhat cool responsive website for challenge 3</h3>

      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
      <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience. It should provide easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors). <sup>1</sup>  Responsive design is designing one web page to be easily viewable on multiple screen sizes.<sup>2</sup>To see responsive design, try resizing your browser smaller smaller and then do the opposite.</p>  
    </div>

    <div class="fluid-layouts">
      <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
      <p>Liquid or fluid layout dimensions are defined in percentages, and as you might expect, this affords greater malleability and fluidity. In other words, by setting a percentage, you won’t have to think about device size or screen width, and consequently, you can find a reasonable solution for each case because your design’s size will adapt to the size of the device used. <sup>3</sup></p>
    </div>

    <div class="your-conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>We think that responsive design and fluid layouts are good practice because it makes your website more accessible to muiltiple devices. Statistics show that as of now 30% off all web-traffic comes from mobile devices. It is crucial for any site to cater to all forms of technology.  <sup>4</sup></p>

      <h2><i>Shomari's Reflection</i></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
        <p>Responsive web design is the process of having websites render correctly no matter what type of device or viewport the user is on.  I do like it because it is clear that we are moving more and more into a mobile world with a verity of devices to vew the web on.  It is good practice to have a responsive web site because you can be confident that no matter where a user is coming from, they are going to have a good user experience. </p>

        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
        <p>The portability of smartphones is what really changed the web.  No longer are people sitting at a desk when veiwing the web.  People use the web for information when they are on the go and the internet has to make adjustments to that.  Web practices will have to continually keep up with the newest techonlogy. As mobile matures and newer tech, like Google glass and wearable devices become more and more prominient. </p>

        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
        <p>I'm not sure how someone who is fully visually impaired is able to use the web.  I think that partially impared people may have trouble seeing different colors and that when we are designing we should keep them in mind when picking what color schemes to use. </p>


        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
        <p>So far, I really like the use of semantic tags in HTML5 instead of endless divs.  I feel that I have a basic understanding of most of the concepts, the biggest issue is getting them to stick and to develop a deeper understanding of them.</p>

      <h2><i> Shreya's Reflection</i></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
        <p>Implementing responsive web designs reassures developers that no matter the device being used, the contents will be displayed appropriately. This in return yields a good user experience. It’s a great concept and should be continuously applied.</p>

        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
        <p>The increasing usage of the web via smartphones and tablets has drastically affected web design. Developers have to make their websites not just accessible from a desktop, but now they have to consider accessibility for newer forms of technology such as smartphones and tablets. How contents appear on a desktop may look completely different on a smaller device, if the design is left as it is. As technology continues to expand, web design will also have to expand to make sure user experience is equal on all platforms of tech.</p>

        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
        <p>Visually impaired people are able to use the web despite their disability. They may heavily rely on their keyboard or software such as screen readers. Also, there are techniques that can be applied to make websites accessible to visually impaired people. I think we should definitely design and develop for this group of people because it’s not they don’t understand the content presented in a website; it’s just that they have difficulty seeing.</p>

        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li>
        <p>I think web design is such a powerful tool. It offers so many ways to modify the web to be more accessible in all forms of technology and to a greater audience.</p>
