<h2>Phase-0-Unit-1 / Week-1 / 8-Wireframing /</h2>

<p> I think the problem Twitter is trying to solve is how to optimize the user interaction with its site. They want the visitors to post as many tweets as possible or click on as many hash-tags as possible. I believe the visual challenge that they overcame was how to address all the clickable elements. Since the entire website is covered with links, itâ€™s important to present those elements in an appealing way.</p>
