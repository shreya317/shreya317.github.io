	<h1>Hungry By Nature</h1>
	Journeying through Chicagoland restaurants and the food made right in my kitchen

	<h3>The Chicago Diner</h3>
	<p>As I continue my vegetarian lifestyle, my appreciation for vegan food has increased significantly. I know being a vegetarian and a vegan is completely different, but having vegan food as an option has made being a vegetarian even more enjoyable.

	Anyone and everyone should go to <a title="The Chicago Diner" href="http://www.veggiediner.com/" target="_blank">The Chicago Diner</a> (even if you eat meat). They have two locations, the original in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=chicago+diner+boystown&ie=UTF-8&ei=eUjMU7HYIte78gWg5oGYCQ&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ" title="Boystown">Boystown</a>, and the second one in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Chicago+Diner:+Logan+Square/@41.923727,-87.698425,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x880fcd6263e0b471:0xdfb32b385eaac5b0" title="Logan Square">Logan Square</a>. I’ve been to both but I prefer the ambiance of the Logan Square location.They are busy at all times of the day, but it’s definitely worth the wait (no reservations taken).

	I’ve been there enough times to try a variety of things, but my must have appetizer is the <em>Special Recipe Wingz </em>served with vegan ranch (so good you will want to drink it) and celery. You can choose from two styles, bbq or spicy buffalo. Unless you can’t take the heat, always pick spicy buffalo. The savory flavor and hearty seitan goodness on the inside, makes these wings irresistible.</p>

	<p> During my recent dine-in, I ordered the <em>Gyros</em>. Unmistakably, a great decision. The succulent seitan gyros were sandwiched in pita bread with chopped onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, with vegan tzatziki sauce. This combination was heaven in my mouth and until this day I salivate at the thought of it (too much info, I know). </p>

	<p> Among the many amazing drinks offered on their menu, the vegan shakes are SPECTACULAR! I once had the <em>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough</em> shake. I don’t know how they do it, but it’s better than any shake I’ve ever had.  You also might want to share; the regular is good for two. </p>

	<p> Well that’s enough of me convincing you why you should go to The Chicago Diner. JUST GO! </p>
