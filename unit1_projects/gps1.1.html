            Pair programming is collaborative means of coding, which involves two programmers. By nimbling changing roles between "driver" and "navigator" the quality of the code they produce together is vastly superior to the code that they could produce individually. Through pair programming the skills parties can be fully realized on a single project. <br /><br /><br /><br />

            Given that students at Development Bootcamp are learning not only coding language, but also to particpate/function as team, this form of collaboration is imperative to the learning process. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        In order to pair program, one person take on the roll of the "navigator", while the other person is the "driver". The navigator's' main responsibility is talking to and leading the driver. As the driver, types the code and gives input. During the process, the roles remain fulid as they swtich back and forth. <br> <br> <br>
